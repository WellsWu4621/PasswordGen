# PasswordGen
Simple code that generates a password based on user input

This site creates a password based on what the user requests.
It will prompt a question for the length of the character (8-128), or an alert if an invalid input was detected
then it will output a confirm for 4 different character types.
Once these are answered, depending on what was chosen a Password will be generated on those conditions.
Depending on the number of different characters, the first few characters will be reserved based on the chosen characters.
Then the remaining characters will be randomized based off of an array created from the given conditions.
The endresult password will also output itself into the console log.

The initial variables are based off of some information provided by the sub instructor Calum
